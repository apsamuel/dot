# Configuration Guide

Turtle can be configured via the `~/.turtlerc` file. This file allows you to customize various aspects of the Turtle shell, including prompt appearance, aliases, environment variables, and more.

## Environment Variables

You can also set environment variables to configure Turtle's behavior. Some common environment variables include:

- `TURTLE_THEME`: Sets the color theme for the Turtle shell.
- `TURTLE_HISTORY_SIZE`: Specifies the number of commands to keep in history.
- `TURTLE_PROMPT`: Customizes the shell prompt format.
