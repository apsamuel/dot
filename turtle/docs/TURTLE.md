# Turtle Language Specification

Turtle is a simple scripting language designed for automating tasks in a shell-like environment. It supports variables, functions, control flow, and built-in commands.

## Syntax

Turtle's syntax is inspired by popular scripting languages, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Here are some key aspects of the syntax:

- **Variables**: Variables are declared using the `let` keyword and can hold values of different types.
- **Functions**: Functions are defined using the `fn` keyword and can take parameters and return values.
- **Control Flow**: Turtle supports `if`, `else`, `while`, and `for` statements for controlling the flow of execution.
- **Built-in Commands**: Turtle includes a set of built-in commands for common tasks, such as `print`, `input`, and `len`.

## Example

Here is a simple example of a Turtle script:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = x + y;
print(z);
```

This script declares three variables, adds them together, and prints the result.

## Built-in Functions

Turtle includes a number of built-in functions that can be used in scripts. Here are some of the most commonly used built-in functions:

- `print(value)`: Prints the specified value to the console.
- `input(prompt)`: Prompts the user for input and returns the entered value.
- `len(array)`: Returns the length of the specified array.

## Conclusion

Turtle is a powerful and easy-to-use scripting language that is well-suited for automating tasks in a shell-like environment. With its simple syntax and built-in functions, Turtle makes it easy to write scripts that can perform complex tasks with minimal effort.
