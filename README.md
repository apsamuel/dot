# ⚫️ Shell Initialization Framework

> Because a shell deserves better than dad jokes, plain defaults and endless plugins.

## About

**`dot`** is shell configuration automation that turns a default shell into a ***productivity powerhouse*** in seconds.

## Features

- 🔋 **Batteries Included**: We know what shell users want, and we include it out of the box.
- 🎨 **Sleek & Modern**: A terminal experience so smooth, you'll think you're in a sci-fi movie 🎬
- ⚙️ **Highly Customizable**: Tweak it, bend it, make it yours. Your terminal, your rules 🛠️
- 🚀 **Performance Optimized**: Because nobody likes a slow shell

## Quick Start

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)  # Tell your system that zsh is your new best friend
source ~/.zshrc        # Let the magic begin
```

## What's Inside?

- 📚 Custom ZSH configurations that would make Linus Torvalds proud
- 🎮 Terminal customizations that look like they're from the future
- 🔧 Tools integration (bat, fzf, tmux) because raw terminal output is so 1970
- 🤖 Auto-completions that finish your commands before you even think of them

## Requirements

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, BSD)
- ZSH installed (version 5.8 or higher recommended)
- A sense of humor (optional, but highly recommended)
