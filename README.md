# 🐢 dot - Your Shell's Personal Trainer

> Because your terminal deserves better than dad jokes and plain defaults

## What is this?

`dot` is a ridiculously over-engineered shell configuration framework that turns your boring terminal into a productivity powerhouse. It's like giving your shell a PhD in computer science, but with more emojis.

## Features

- 🚀 **Zero to Hero**: Goes from "command not found" to "I am become death, destroyer of bugs" in seconds
- ☁️ **Cloud-Savvy**: Syncs your secrets and settings via iCloud, because losing your aliases is so 2022
- 🎨 **Pretty Things**: Configurable splash screens (quotes or ASCII art, because why not both?)
- 🧠 **Smart History**: Remembers your last million commands, because you'll totally need that one-liner from 2021
- 🔐 **Secure**: Manages your SSH keys and secrets like a paranoid security guard
- 🎯 **Plugin Power**: Plays nice with oh-my-zsh plugins without the bloat

## Quick Start

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)  # Tell your system that zsh is your new best friend
source ~/.zshrc        # Let the magic begin
```

## What's Inside?

- 📚 Custom ZSH configurations that would make Linus Torvalds proud
- 🎮 Terminal customizations that look like they're from the future
- 🔧 Tools integration (bat, fzf, tmux) because raw terminal output is so 1970
- 🤖 Auto-completions that finish your commands before you even think of them

## Not Just Another Framework

Unlike other shell frameworks that try to be everything to everyone, `dot` is like a bespoke suit - it's tailored to fit perfectly while making you look fancy.

## Requirements

- A Mac (because we're fancy like that)
- ZSH (because bash is so yesterday)
- A sense of humor (optional, but highly recommended)

## Warning

May cause:

- Excessive productivity
- Terminal envy from coworkers
- Uncontrollable urge to customize everything
- Inability to use default shell configurations ever again
